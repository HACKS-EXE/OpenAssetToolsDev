# Documentation

You can find the main documentation for OAT here: [https://openassettools.dev](https://openassettools.dev/).
It brings everything you need for getting started as well as other guides and reference.

In case you want to contribute to documentation you can find its source [here](https://github.com/OpenAssetTools/Docs).
All that remains in this project for now are example projects.
